# TechCon 2024 Conference Website

This project challenges you to build a comprehensive website for the **TechCon 2024** conference using HTML. You’ll create various webpages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the conference, while incorporating essential HTML elements and best practices.

## Project Scope

The website will consist of five core webpages:

1. **Homepage (index.html)**: 
   - This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.

2. **About Page (about.html)**: 
   - This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.

3. **Schedule Page (schedule.html)**: 
   - This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.

4. **Register Page (register.html)**: 
   - This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.

5. **Contact Page (contact.html)**: 
   - This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.

## Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, you’ll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

- **HTML Structure**: 
  - Solidify your understanding of fundamental HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.

- **Headings and Text**: 
  - Learn to structure headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (`<p>`) and other text formatting elements effectively.

- **Links and Navigation**: 
  - Implement hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.

- **Tables**: 
  - Create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.

- **Forms**: 
  - Design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the `<form>` tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.

- **Images and Multimedia**: 
  - Incorporate images (using `<img>` tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. Explore embedding a promotional video (using the `<video>` tag) and an interactive Google Map (using `<iframe>`) on the Contact page.
